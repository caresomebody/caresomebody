I am a dedicated professional in software quality assurance (QA) who is committed to delivering high-quality products to users. I have a strong background in manual and automation testing, including experience in mobile, web, API, and functional testing. I am skilled at identifying and resolving defects in software, and I am responsible for creating, developing, and executing test cases. I work closely with developers to ensure that the software meets the required specifications. Additionally, I have an interest in product management and UI/UX.
